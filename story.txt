For the holidays, Professor Mehlhase decided to rent a Porsche to visit with family members.
During the visit, they attended a Rammstein concert and afterwards all visited the local Biergarten.
At the local Biergarten, Professor Mehlhase bought some Bratwurst sandwiches for herself and each of her family members.
Everyone loved the Brot, especially her Hund.
Her hund quickly finshed the bratwurst and resumed chewing on the Professor's fancy Dirndel much to her dismay.
After the mishap with the Hund, the team decided to head to the local Ratskeller to laugh it all off.
The Ratskeller had a special deal on fresh gebaeck and Apfelkuche from the local Backerei.
Afterwards they all decided to go with one car, a BMW, to the local Schloss for some sightseeing.
The Lederhose that it was in was beautiful, especially the Hauptstrasse.
The view from the Hauptstrasse of the Eltz was stunning.
Next to the Eltz was a Baeckerei, and inside they were making Gebaeck.
The gabaeck are hand crafted using an ancient recipe discovered under a Schloss.
They joked that their day was more thrilling than any day at the Flughafen
